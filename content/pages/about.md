Iâ€™m an experienced technologist and entrepreneur living in Oakland, CA with my wife and our two critters (a cat and a dog). I love the ever-evolving technology of software and the art and science of software engineering. I also love picking a guitar and riding a motorcycle, but not at the same time.
